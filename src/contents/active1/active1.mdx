# Become engineer

I started working for an IT company in Tokyo as a software engineer in
April 2023.

# Newcomer training

The first month in the company was spent training new recruits. The theme was
Android applications. There were three people working on it and I was in charge
of the back-end and mobile front-end implementation. It was the first time I had
the experience of developing and completing a project from scratch as part of a
team, and I feel very happy about it.

# Project assignment

After the completion of the newcomer training, they were assigned to a project.
I have been in various areas of technology.

1. ios/android development
1. Raspi/Android development
1. ios webview development etc.

# Future

I can build systems using Raspi and programmes using python, but I would like to strengthen my technical skills with a focus on web and smartphone front-end technologies. I want to acquire the skills to keep up.
