# Overview

I study independently outside of work on weekdays and on holidays.

# Type of learning

What kind of learning is taking place is described below and below.

- Investigation of technologies of concern.
- Creating what you suddenly wanted to create.
- In-depth exploration of technologies investigated during working hours.

# Technological area

The area of most learning is the front end of the web. It is evolving very quickly and I try not to get left behind. Sometimes, if I am curious about something in other areas, such as Python, I create prototype code and investigate.

# Feature.

I intend to continue my self-study with a focus on the front end of the web. I will actively participate in the project if I am invited by my friends.
